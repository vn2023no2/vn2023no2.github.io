# ITSM, ITIL, SRE

## ITSM

In the world of tech, basic fundamentals include `Information Technology Service Management` (ITSM), a systematic approach through which IT teams oversee the complete lifecycle of IT services provided to customers. This includes all processes and actions involved in designing, creating, delivering and supporting IT services. Crucial for maintaining consistent product performance, ITSM consists of service management, change management, problem and incident management, asset management and knowledge management.
Central to ITSM are five key stages that guide its implementation:
- Service strategy
- Service design
- Service transition
- Service operation
Continual service improvement

The evolution of tech has given rise to various ITSM frameworks. Among the most prominent are the Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) and site reliability engineering (SRE). Each offers unique benefits and applications tailored to different organizational needs and contexts.
